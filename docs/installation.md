## Download the App

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/james-see/ltx-video-mac/releases)
2. Download the latest `.dmg` file
3. Open the DMG and drag **LTX Video Generator** to your Applications folder
4. Right-click the app and select **Open** (required for first launch of notarized apps)

## Configure Python

LTX Video Generator needs Python 3.10+ with MLX and related packages.

### Step 1: Open Preferences

1. Launch **LTX Video Generator**
2. Open **Preferences** (⌘,)
3. Click **Auto Detect** to find your Python installation

The app will search common locations including Homebrew, pyenv, conda, and system Python.

### Step 2: Validate Setup

Click **Validate Setup** to check for required packages:
- `mlx` - Apple's machine learning framework
- `mlx-vlm` - Vision-language models for MLX
- `mlx-video-with-audio` - Unified audio-video generation (LTX-2)
- `transformers` - Hugging Face transformers
- `safetensors` - Fast tensor serialization
- `huggingface_hub` - Model downloading
- `numpy` - Numerical computing
- `opencv-python` - Video encoding
- `tqdm` - Progress bars

### Step 3: Install Missing Packages

If packages are missing, you have two options:

**Option A: One-Click Install (Recommended)**

Click the **Install Missing Packages** button in Preferences. The app will run pip install automatically.

**Option B: Manual Install**

```bash
pip install mlx mlx-vlm mlx-video-with-audio transformers safetensors huggingface_hub numpy opencv-python tqdm
```

{: .note }
If using a virtual environment, make sure to activate it first, or point the app to the venv's Python executable.

## First Run - Model Download

{: .warning }
**Important**: On your first generation, the app will download the LTX-2 Unified model (~42GB) from Hugging Face. This is a one-time download.

### What to Expect

1. Start a generation with any prompt
2. Progress shows "Downloading model..." with percentage
3. Download takes 30-60 minutes depending on connection speed
4. Model is cached in `~/.cache/huggingface/hub/`
5. Subsequent runs skip the download

### Download Progress

The app shows real-time download progress:
- `Downloading: 8.4GB / 42GB (20%)`

If download is interrupted, it will resume from where it left off.

### Storage Location

Models are cached by Hugging Face in:
```
~/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--notapalindrome--ltx2-mlx-av/
```

To free up space later, you can delete this folder (the model will re-download on next use).

## Optional: Gemma Prompt Enhancement

For better results, enable **Settings > Generation > Enable Gemma Prompt Enhancement**. Gemma rewrites your prompts with vivid details before generation.

If prompts with certain words (e.g. medical terms) return empty enhancement, enable **Use uncensored enhancer**. First run downloads ~7GB (TheCluster/amoral-gemma-3-12B-v2-mlx-4bit).

## Verify Installation

To verify everything is working:

1. Enter a simple prompt: `"A river flowing through a forest"`
2. Use the **Quick Preview** preset (512x320, 49 frames)
3. Click **Generate**
4. Watch progress in the Queue sidebar
5. Your video should appear when complete

## Installing Python

If you don't have Python installed, here are your options:

### Homebrew (Recommended)

```bash
brew install python@3.12
```

Python will be at `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.12`

### pyenv

```bash
# Install pyenv
brew install pyenv

# Install Python
pyenv install 3.12

# Set as default
pyenv global 3.12
```

### System Python

macOS includes Python, but you may need to install Xcode Command Line Tools:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Python not found"
- Click **Auto Detect** in Preferences
- Or manually enter the path to your Python executable
- Verify it exists: `which python3`

### "Missing packages" after install
- Make sure you're using the same Python the app is configured to use
- Try: `/path/to/your/python3 -m pip install mlx mlx-vlm mlx-video-with-audio transformers safetensors huggingface_hub numpy opencv-python tqdm`

### "Out of memory" during generation
- Use smaller resolution (512x320)
- Reduce frame count
- Close other applications
- 32GB RAM minimum required

See the [Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshooting) for more solutions.
